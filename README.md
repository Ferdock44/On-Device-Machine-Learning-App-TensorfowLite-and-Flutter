# Transfer-Learning-App-TensorfowLite-and-Flutter
1) **Created a Convolutional Neural Network using Transfer Learning in Tensorflow and Keras in Jupyter Notebook.**
> *Stored inside the ```pythonscripts.ipynb``` file*
2) **Converted and Exported it as a .tflite into a Flutter Project**
>  *All app files are in the ```transfer_learning_fruit_veggies``` folder.*
3) **Using plugins like tflite and image_picker, and on-device machine learning, created this app that is able to detect 30+ different types of fruits and vegetables.**
> *Test this project out yourself, by cloning the repository into Visual Studio Code*
